# Spring Playground

## Purpose

Having a project always ready as starting point for a spring boot application or just a playground to try something.

## Features

* Configure DispatcherServlet for loadOnStartup, so no delays on first call consumed (`ample.Application.initializeDispatcherServlet`).
* Custom Error Handling of any exceptions (`sample.service.ErrorHandler`)

### Happy coding!
